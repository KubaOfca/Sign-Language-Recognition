# Sign-Language-Recognition

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize Sign Language hand gestures. The model classifies images of hand signs into corresponding letters, enabling real-time translation of sign language into text. It is trained on a dataset of alphabet signs.
It includes a real-time functionality that uses a camera to detect hand signs live and predict the corresponding letter.
